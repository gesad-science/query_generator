ol√°, marcelo! peguei teu contato com o j√∫lio taveira, que foi meu colega de trabalho durante muitos anos na ti da prf. 

estou procurando uma realoca√ß√£o no mercado internacional na √°rea de machine learning / nlp / dados e, conversando com j√∫lio, surgiu a ideia de te contactar.

estou no limiar de terminar meu mestrado e tamb√©m finalizando alguns processos seletivos e pensei que talvez fosse uma boa hora de explorar outras possibilidades antes de me comprometer com alguma outra empresa, ainda mais considerando as boas refer√™ncias que o j√∫lio me deu de voc√™.

no meu linkedin voc√™ pode obter mais detalhes sobre minha experi√™ncia, mas, basicamente j√° tive a oportunidade de colaborar com diversos tipos de projetos, em diferentes fun√ß√µes e com diferentes tecnologias. tenho muito interesse em continuar na ind√∫stria o trabalho que venho fazendo com machine learning na academia. caso saiba de alguma oportunidade, por favor me avise, ok?

qualquer d√∫vida ou informa√ß√£o complementar, sigo √† disposi√ß√£o.

obrigado e me desculpe em caso de alguma inconveni√™ncia.
